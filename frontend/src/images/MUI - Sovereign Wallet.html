                        Many people use the default gas price from their wallet when they make a transaction, and this is generally OK. However, sometimes it makes sense to pay more if you want the transaction to be quickly concluded, or you may want to save some money and offer a cheap gas price, especially if you don't care how long it will take.
                        <br data-v-2f451376=""> <br data-v-2f451376="">
                        Therefore, we publish these recommendations to simplify the gas price choice based on desired transaction speed and cost:
                        <br data-v-2f451376=""> <br data-v-2f451376=""> <br data-v-2f451376="">
                        1) Safe low - This is a gas price that is intended to be both cheap and successful. It may take a bit longer to get a confirmation with this price (e.g. 5minutes), but it is safe to use and should be confirmed propmpty. This price is determined by the lowest price where at least 5% of the network hash power will accept it. It requires that at least 50 transactions have been mined in the last 24 hours at this price. Furthermore, we monitor the network in real time and will update this price if a transaction at or above does not confirm within 50 blocks<br data-v-2f451376=""> <br data-v-2f451376="">
                        2) Average - This is the price accepted by top miners who account for at least 50% of the blocks mined- safe and prompt. Usually reflects the wallet defaults.<br data-v-2f451376=""> <br data-v-2f451376="">
                        3) Fastest - This is the lowest gas price that is accepted by all top miners (estimated over the last two days). Therefore, transactions with this gas price should be accepted by all the top pools. Paying more than this price is unlikely to increase transaction confirmation time under normal circumstances.<br data-v-2f451376=""> <br data-v-2f451376=""></p><p data-v-2f451376="" style="text-align: center;"><b data-v-2f451376="">

                        otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of the SFA.
                        PART B - SANCTIONS LAW REPRESENTATIONS
                        You acknowledge and agree that:
                        You are not:
                        currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered or enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("OFAC'), the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the United Kingdom or other relevant sanctions authority (collectively, "Sanctions"); nor

                        You:
                        represent and covenant that you will not use the proceeds of the sale of any MUI Tokens and will not, directly or indirectly, use, lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any of Your subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other Person (A) for the purpose of funding or facilitating any activities or business of or with any Person or in any country that, at the time of such funding or facilitation, is the subject of Sanctions; or (B) in any other manner that will result in a violation of Sanctions by any Person (including any Person participating in  each Phase of Public Sale as adviser or otherwise); and

                        You shall comply with all laws relating to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism including all applicable statutes of all jurisdictions in which You are located, resident, organized or operate, and/or to which you may otherwise be subject and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the "Money Laundering Laws"); and/or
                        No action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving You or any of Your Affiliates with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the best of Your knowledge (after due and careful enquiry), threatened.

                        EXHIBIT 2 - RISK FACTORS
                        An acquisition of the MUI Tokens involves a high degree of risk. Users should carefully consider the following information about these risks before they decide to buy the MUI Tokens. If any of the following risks actually occurs, it could have a material, adverse effect on the business, the MUI Token Platform and/or the value of the MUI Tokens.
                        We have described the risks and uncertainties that We believe are material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones the parties ultimately face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those We are currently not aware of or deem immaterial, may also have a material, adverse effect on the business, the MUI Token Platform and/or the value of the MUI Tokens.
                        RISKS CONNECTED TO THE VALUE OF MUI TOKENS
                        No Rights, Functionality or Features: The MUI Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, except for those which are specifically described in the White Paper and which may change from time to time.
                        Lack of Development of Market for MUI Tokens: Because there has been no prior public trading market for the MUI Tokens, the MUI Token sale may not result in an active or liquid market for the MUI Tokens, and their price may be highly volatile. An active public market may not develop or be sustained after the MUI Token sale. If a liquid trading market for the MUI Tokens does not develop, the price of the MUI Tokens may become more volatile and the MUI Token holder may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in the MUI Tokens at anytime. We do not in any way give any assurances that the MUI Tokens will be exchangeable on any cryptographic exchanges or secondary markets.
                        Risks Relating to Highly Speculative Traded Price: The valuation of digital MUI Tokens in a secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative. The MUI Tokens do not hold any ownership rights to Our assets or the assets of Our Affiliates and, therefore, are not backed by any tangible asset. Notwithstanding our automated stabilization tools, the sale price of the MUI Tokens may fluctuate greatly within a short period of time. There is a high risk that a MUI Token holder could lose his/her entire contribution amount and that the MUI Tokens could be rendered worthless.
                        MUI Tokens May Have No Value: The MUI Tokens may have no value and there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the MUI Tokens. We are not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of the MUI Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the MUI Tokens and/or the availability of any market for the MUI Tokens through third parties or otherwise.
                        MUI Tokens are Non-Refundable: We are not obliged to provide the MUI Token holders with a refund related to the MUI Tokens for any reason, and the MUI Token holders acknowledge and agree that they will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of a refund. No promises of future performance or price are or will be made in respect to the MUI Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the MUI Tokens will hold any particular value. Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to foreign laws or regulations, which may not be the same as the laws in the jurisdiction of the MUI Token holder.
                        BLOCKCHAIN AND SOFTWARE RISKS
                        Blockchain Delay Risk: On most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, the cryptocurrency sent as a payment for the MUI Tokens in the final seconds of the MUI Token sale may not get included into that period. The respective blockchain may not include the User’s transaction at the time User expects and the payment for the MUI Tokens may not reach the intended wallet address on the same day that the User sends the cryptocurrency.
                        Blockchain Congestion Risk: Most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing MUI Tokens. That may result in a situation where block producers may not include the User’s transaction when the User wants or the User’s transaction may not be included at all.
                        Risk of Software Weaknesses: The MUI Token Electronic Contract concept, the underlying software application and software platform are still in an early development stage and unproven. There are no representations and warranties that the process for creating the MUI Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free. There is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the cryptocurrency and/or the MUI Tokens.
                        Risk of New Technology: The MUI Token Platform, the MUI Tokens and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested. In particular, We believe that the automated stabilization tools that we have to manage the circulation of the MUI Tokens (such as the algorithmic central bank and the Sovereign Governance System) and the messenger-style wallet are first of their kind. Any such unique features of the MUI Token Platform and the MUI Tokens might not be capable of full completion, creation, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the full proposed functionality of the MUI Token Platform will be ever launched. User should not rely on the MUI Token Platform, the MUI Token Electronic Contract or the ability to receive the MUI Tokens associated with the MUI Token Platform in the future. Even if the MUI Token Platform is fully completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any MUI Tokens may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the MUI Token Platform and the MUI Tokens may become outdated.
                        SECURITY RISKS
                        Risk of Loss of Access to Wallet: The MUI Tokens may be held by a User only in his MUI Token wallet on The SovereignWallet App.   Accordingly, loss of any details required to obtain access to such wallet could result in an inability to access the User’s MUI Tokens, access to the User’s MUI Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service the User uses, may be able to misappropriate a Users’ MUI Tokens.
                        No Assurance of MUI Token Security: While we believe our platform offers a high degree of security, there can be no assurance of this. The MUI Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the MUI Token Electronic Contract or the MUI Tokens in a variety of ways, including malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the MUI Token Platform rests on an open source software, there is the risk that the MUI Token contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may adversely affect the MUI Tokens or result in the loss of MUI Tokens, or the loss of ability to access or control the MUI Tokens. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and Users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.
                        Attacks on MUI Token Electronic Contract: The blockchain used for the MUI Token Electronic Contract is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the MUI Token Electronic Contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of the MUI Token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
                        Dependence on a Single Wallet: At present, the MUI Tokens can only be stored in the MUI Token wallet on The SovereignWallet App. Any failure of a User to maintain such a wallet may result in the User being unable to gain access to his MUI Tokens.
                        RISKS RELATING TO PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT
                        Risk Related to Reliance on Third Parties: Even if completed, the MUI Token Platform will rely, in whole or in part, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet requirements, all of which might have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform.
                        Dependence of Platform on Senior Management Team: The success of the senior management team of the Platform Provider, is dependent to a large degree on the services of each member of that team. The loss or diminution in the services of any member of the senior management team or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management personnel, could have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform. Competition for personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualified individuals, and this situation may adversely impact the Platform Provider’s ability to retain existing senior management and/or attract additional qualified senior management personnel, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform.
                        Dependence of Platform on Various Factors: The development of the MUI Token Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial feasibility or departure of key personnel.
                        Lack of Interest to the Platform: Even if the MUI Token Platform is completed, adopted and launched, the ongoing success of the MUI Token Platform relies on the interest and participation of third parties like developers. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the MUI Token Platform.
                        Changes to the Platform: The MUI Token Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although the project management team of the Platform Provider intends for the MUI Token Platform to have the features and specifications set forth in the White Paper, changes to such features and specifications can be made for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that the MUI Token Platform does not meet expectations of holder of the MUI Tokens.
                        Risk associated with Other Applications: The launch of the MUI Token Platform may encourage other, alternative projects with a similar business model, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which the MUI Token will have no intrinsic value.
                        Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Cryptocurrency Value: The proceeds of the sale of the MUI Tokens will be denominated in cryptocurrency, and may be converted into other cryptographic and/ or fiat currencies. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after  each Phase of Public Sale, the project management team for the Platform Provider may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the MUI Token Platform in the manner that it intended.
                        RISKS ARISING IN THE COURSE OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS
                        Risks Relating to the Commercial success of Our Application: The commercial success of the MUI Token Platform is subject to a number of factors beyond Our control and/or the control of the Platform Provider, such as:
                        ability / inability to meet users' expectations regarding the functionality of the MUI Token Platform;
                        interest from a limited number of users;
                        limited bandwidth to manage unexpected growth;
                        inability to continuously adapt the business model underlying the MUI Token to meet market needs;
                        significant competition from new and existing players in this space who introduce similar applications; and
                        any other new and untested technology that underlies the MUI Token Platform in the future may not function as planned.
                        Risks Relating to the Development and Acceptance of Blockchain Networks: The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, including the network on which the MUI Token is based, are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, which is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain-enabled digital representation of rights could have an adverse material effect on the utility of the MUI Tokens. The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks with which the  MUI Token will rely and interact, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency industry, as well as blockchain networks, include, without limitation:
                        worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoin, Ether and other blockchain technologies;
                        government and quasi-government regulation of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;
                        the maintenance and development of the open-source software of the Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrency networks;
                        changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
                        the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using fiat currencies or existing networks;
                        general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and
                        a decline in the popularity or acceptance of the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other networks.
                        The slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may deter or delay the acceptance and adoption of the MUI Tokens.
                        Limited Historical Information: We and our Affiliates are start-up companies, and, therefore have limited prior business operations, financial historical information and other business information relating to the business operations or future prospects of the group.
                        Risk of Conflicts of Interest: We may be engaged in transactions with related parties, including companies controlled by Us or in which We own an interest, and other Affiliates, and may continue to do so in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise between any of Our Affiliates and Us, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on terms not determined by market forces.
                        Risks Related to Invalidation of Transactions: We and Our Affiliates have taken a variety of actions relating to the business that, if successfully challenged for not complying with Applicable Law, could be invalidated or could result in the imposition of liabilities on Us. Since applicable legislation may be subject to many different interpretations, We may not be able to successfully defend any challenge brought against such transactions, and the invalidation of any such transactions or imposition of any such liability may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform.
                        Risk Arising from Emerging Markets: We operate in several emerging markets. Emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic and political risks. Emerging economies are subject to rapid change and the User understands that the information set out in this Token Usage Agreement and the White Paper may become outdated relatively quickly.
                        Lack of Information:  A holder of MUI Tokens may not be able to obtain all information it would want regarding the MUI Token on a timely basis or at all going forward. It is possible that the holder may not therefore be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that have occurred which could affect the MUI Tokens.
                        Compliance Burden: Our business and industry is subject to compliance with a number of laws including those relating to data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements including those that could require Us to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm Our reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of Our security measures, adversely impact Our ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the MUI Token Platform.
                        GOVERNMENTAL RISKS
                        Uncertain Regulatory Framework: The regulatory status of cryptocurrency, digital assets, blockchain technology and decentralised exchanges is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies particularly as We believe the MUI Token Platform offers several first-of-its-kind features. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptocurrency, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could adversely impact the MUI Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that the MUI Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. You should be aware that neither We nor the White Paper nor the MUI Tokens are registered with any securities regulator in any jurisdiction including, in Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore. We and/or the Platform Provider (as applicable) may cease the distribution of the MUI Tokens, the development of the MUI Token Platform and/or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.
                        Failure to Obtain, Maintain or Renew Licenses and Permits. We may require a number of permits, licenses, authorisations, consents, decrees, waivers, approvals and filings (statutory, regulatory or otherwise) to lawfully operate the business in accordance with Applicable Law (the “Approvals”). There is a risk that requirements for Approvals for carrying out each Phase of Public Sale may be adopted in the future and may relate to Us. In this case, the business will depend on obtaining such required Approvals, the continuing validity of such Approvals and Our compliance with their terms. Regulatory authorities will exercise considerable discretion in the timing of Approval issuance and renewal and the monitoring of Our compliance with the terms of such Approvals. Requirements which may by imposed by these authorities and which may require Us and/or the Platform Provider to comply with numerous standards, recruit qualified personnel, maintain necessary technical equipment and quality control systems, monitor  operations, maintain appropriate filings and, upon request, submit appropriate information to the licensing authorities, may be costly and time- consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of operation of the MUI Token Platform. Further, private individuals and the public at large may possess rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the Approval process, including through intervention in courts and political pressure. Accordingly, the Approvals We may need may not be issued or renewed, or if issued or renewed, may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements which restrict Our ability to conduct operations or to do so profitably.
                        Risk of Government Action: The industry in which We operate is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine Our operations and/or pursue enforcement actions against Us. All of this may subject Us and/or the Platform Provider to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Us to restructure Our operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Our reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the MUI Tokens and/or the development of the MUI Token Platform.
                        Risk of Burdensomeness of Applicable Laws, Regulations, and Standards: Failure to comply with Applicable Law or the findings of government inspections, or increased governmental regulation of Our operations, could result in substantial additional compliance costs or various sanctions, which could materially adversely affect Our business and the MUI Token Platform. Our operations and properties are subject to regulation by various government entities and agencies, in connection with ongoing compliance with Applicable Law. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in matters of enforcement and interpretation of Applicable Law. Respective authorities have the right to conduct periodic inspections of Our operations and properties throughout the year. Any such future inspections may conclude that We have violated laws, decrees or regulations, and We may be unable to refute such conclusions or remedy the violations. Our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or the findings of government inspections may result in the imposition of fines or penalties or more severe sanctions or in requirements We cease certain business activities, or in criminal and administrative penalties applicable to Our officers. Any such decisions, requirements or sanctions, or any increase in governmental regulation of respective operations, could increase Our costs and have a material adverse effect on the business and the MUI Token Platform.
                        Unlawful or Arbitrary Government Action: Governmental authorities may have a high degree of discretion and, at times, act selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary to law or influenced by political or commercial considerations. Moreover, governmental authorities also have the power in certain circumstances, by regulation or government act, to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts. Unlawful, selective or arbitrary governmental actions have reportedly included the denial or withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities have also used common defects in matters surrounding a MUI Token sale as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate or to void any related transaction, often for political purposes. In this environment, Our competitors may receive preferential treatment from the government, potentially giving them a competitive advantage over Us.
                        Risks Relating to Taxation: The tax treatment of acquisition of MUI Tokens (through purchase or otherwise) is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for acquirers. Each acquirer must seek its own tax advice in connection with the purchase of MUI Tokens. The acquisition of MUI Tokens may result in adverse tax consequences to acquirers, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements. Each acquirer should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of the acquisition of MUI Tokens.
                        RISKS RELATING TO  EACH PHASE OF PUBLIC SALE
                        Risks Relating to  each Phase of Public Sale Process: You are subject to certain risks as a result of each Phase of Public Sale process.  You understand that these risks include the following:

                        We reserve the right to change the timing, sale price, and number of MUI Tokens available for sale at any time during  each Phase of Public Sale;
                        We reserve the right to terminate the sale process at any time and withdraw any unsold MUI Tokens from each Phase of Public Sale; and
                        You may not be able to acquire any MUI Tokens if, among other things, We believe you are a Restricted Person or that a Regulatory Event has occurred.

                        EXHIBIT 3 - PUBLIC SALE PROCEDURES
                        We propose to conduct public sales of the MUI Tokens to be taken in subsequent phases of which time, date, and price shall be determined by Us. We shall publish a Public Notice concerning the public sales with the details of each phase, as soon as reasonably practicable and convenient to Users. It is Your responsibility to regularly check The Site, SovereignWallet social networks  and The SovereignWallet App for such notices.
                        Phases of Public Sale
                        The first phase of the public sale of the MUI Tokens (the "First Phase Public Sale") was set at 10:00 am SGT on June 27, 2018 ("First Phase Sale Launch Time").

                        The accomplish date was established at SGT midnight time, on July 31, 2018;
                        immediately after the time when Users have completed Purchases of 100,000,000 (One hundred million) MUI Tokens (the "Maximum Amount" established to that phase), public notification was conducted by Us on The Site and on The SovereignWallet App.
                        (such time was established as the "First Phase Expiration Time").
                        The period starting from the First Phase Sale Launch Time and ending at the First Phase Expiration Time shall be referred to as the "First Phase Public Sale Period". The subsequent phases shall be conducted as the following related phase "Public Sale Period."
                        For Users participating in Public Sale Period, the Token exchange rate will be decided at Our discretion based in 1 ETH (the "Token Exchange Rate").
                        The minimum purchase requirement applicable for the First Phase Public Sale is MUI tokens in an amount that equals 1 ETH.
                        The second phase of the public sale of the MUI Tokens (the "Second Phase Public Sale"), was held at 10:00 am SGT on September 05, 2018 ("Second Phase Sale Start Time") and concluding date at:
                        1.5.1. midnight SGT on September 30, 2018;
                        1.5.2. the price and volume issued to the public to purchase was the total amount of 50,000,000 (Fifty million) MUI Tokens (the "Maximum Amount" established to this phase).
                        1.6 	Subsequent phases of the Public Sale shall follow similar procedure, and the time, date, price and volume of MUI Tokens to be sold shall be determine by Us from time to time.
                        Process for Purchase of MUI Tokens-Payment Information
                        Payment for the purchase of MUI Tokens shall only be accepted:
                        in advance;
                        in Ethereum; and
                        by transfer of such Ethereum to Us through Your Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App, which can be achieved by clicking on the "Buy" button on the market UI in The SovereignWallet App (such event a "Purchase Event" and each such valid purchase, a "Purchase").
                        For the avoidance of doubt, the price of the MUI Tokens shall not be set in fiat currency and We will not accept any fiat currency towards the payment of the MUI Tokens.
                        A MUI Token is divisible and therefore fractional components of a MUI Token may be in issue up to six decimal places.  However, we may not issue any fractional components of MUI Tokens in  any Phase of Public Sale.
                        A User's entitlement to MUI Tokens (if any) in  each Phase of Public Sale Period (the "Token Entitlement Amount") shall be:
                        the amount of Ethereum submitted to Us in a Purchase Event; divided by
                        the Token Exchange Rate.
                        Notwithstanding anything contained herein, We will only consider a payment for the MUI Tokens by a User as completed once We are in a position to confirm receipt of such payment including confirming to Our satisfaction that any payment transaction has not been cancelled or reversed by the respective blockchain ledger.
                        For the avoidance of doubt, Users are reminded that on most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions, timing of block production is determined by proof-of-work, so block production can occur. For example, the cryptocurrency sent as a payment for the MUI Tokens in the final seconds of  each Phase of Public Sale may not get included into that period. The respective blockchain may not include the User's transaction at the time User expects and the payment for the MUI Tokens may not reach the intended wallet address on the same day that the User sends the cryptocurrency.
                        If We are unable to confirm payment as described in Clause 2.6 hereof, the transaction for payment for the MUI Tokens will be deemed cancelled and reversed by the respective blockchain ledger. In this case, the respective amount of payment made by a User will be refunded to such User without distribution to him of any MUI Tokens subject to the terms and conditions herein.
                        Process for Purchase of MUI Tokens -Additional Information
                        We shall have certain information on each Phase of Public Sale available on The SovereignWallet Network website and other platforms to be decided by Us. However, purchases of MUI Tokens can only be completed on The SovereignWallet App.
                        To purchase the MUI Tokens through The SovereignWallet App, a User must:
                        complete certain registration procedures on The SovereignWallet App to set up a user account;
                        complete Our KYC process including submitting any required documentation to our service providers; and
                        After  receiving email of confirmation.
                        Users are reminded that given the complexity of the KYC process, the verification may fail or be delayed and that they can only purchase the MUI Tokens once they have been verified by Us from a KYC perspective.
                        Once a User has been verified:
                        We will open an account for the User on The SovereignWallet App which will include an Ethereum wallet and a MUI token wallet;
                        such User will be able to make payment by ETH from its Ethereum wallet for purchase of MUI Tokens in each Phase of Public Sale; and
                        such User shall be able to purchase MUI Tokens and see registered purchases of MUI Tokens within its MUI token account on The SovereignWallet App.
                        We reserve the right to refuse or cancel purchase requests for MUI Tokens at any time in Our sole discretion, including cases when
                        the information provided by User upon any requests is not sufficient, inaccurate or misleading;
                        a User is believed to be a Restricted Person; or
                        a User has not complied with any of the requirements of The SovereignWallet App.
                        In the case specified in Clause 3.5 hereof, We may, at Our sole discretion, either:
                        retain all the funds paid by the respective payer if required by Applicable Law; or
                        refund to the payer of the funds in accordance with Clause 8 hereof.
                        Bonus Programs
                        Certain Users may be eligible to receive additional MUI Tokens at no payment ("Bonus Tokens") based on the eligibility criteria detailed in our White Paper.
                        Other than as stated in Clause 4.1 hereof, We may launch different bonus programs enabling different persons to receive the Bonus Tokens. Different bonus programs may be launched for the benefit of different persons.
                        Bonus programs stated in Clauses  4.1 to 4.2 inclusive may be additive, however, to the extent that applies to Users, the Bonus Tokens to be due within each such bonus program can be accrued only depending on the number of MUI Tokens that was actually paid for by a respective User.
                        Bonus Tokens may also be issued in fractional components of MUI Tokens.
                        User's Wallets
                        To purchase the MUI Tokens, a User must utilize the wallet in The SovereignWallet App that is established and operational and for which such a user controls the private key.
                        For the avoidance of doubt, Users shall not be permitted to use any other wallet including any wallet that belongs to an exchange for cryptocurrency.
                        Creation and Distribution of MUI Tokens
                        Through the MUI Token Electronic Contract, a maximum total of 1,000, 000,000 (one billion) MUI Tokens have been generated and are being held by Us pending distribution.
                        Following a valid Purchase Event in respect of a User, We shall promptly procure:
                        the reflection of such results into the MUI Token Electronic Contract; and
                        the allocation of an amount of MUI Tokens equal to the Token Entitlement Amount to that User through the MUI Token Electronic Contract to their respective MUI Token wallets on The SovereignWallet App.
                        At the end of each Phase of Public Sale Period, we will procure that the MUI Token Electronic Contract has a fully updated results of the sale and distribution of MUI Tokens in each Phase of Public Sale (and including the number of the Bonus Tokens issued in each Phase of Public Sale Period, if applicable).
                        The total number of MUI Tokens which will be distributed through the Token Electronic Contract shall be equal to the sum of the following:
                        the aggregate of:
                        The total number of the MUI Tokens paid for and distributed to Users in the each Public Sale together with the total number of the Bonus Tokens accrued to any parties (and that are credited as paid for) in the First Phase Public Sale, in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof the "Public Sales Tokens Procedures"); and
                        the total number of the MUI Tokens paid for and distributed to Users in any further public sales that we may conduct together with the total number of the Bonus Tokens accrued to any parties (and that are credited as paid for) in any such further public sales, in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof (the "Future Public Sale Tokens"),
                        Provided that the aggregate number of First Phase Public Sale Tokens and the following Public Sale Tokens including the First and Second Phases described in the terms of 3.3 and 3.7 above, in any case, shall not exceed 800,000,000 (eight hundred million) MUI Tokens;
                        The total number of MUI Tokens that are allocated to Us (and credited as paid for) for future distributions to Our team, Our advisors, and Our initial Users ("Retained Tokens") shall not exceed 100,000,000 (one hundred million) MUI Tokens; and
                        The total number of MUI Tokens that we distribute to Users as Bonus Tokens from time to time in connection with their use of The SovereignWallet App (and which are credited as paid for) shall not exceed 100,000,000 (one hundred million) MUI Tokens.
                        The number of MUI Tokens due to each User, Us or the third party (if any), will be distributed by the Token Electronic Contract.
                        The Retained Tokens will be distributed by the MUI Token Electronic Contract to Us. We anticipate using the Retained Tokens, in Our sole discretion, for the purposes indicated in the White Paper.
                        Prior to the First Phase Public Sale Period, We have already conducted a pre-sale period in which 241,656,353 MUI Tokens were offered on a discounted basis by us from the Future Public Sale Tokens (the "Pre-Sale").
                        Stop of Distribution Process
                        We reserve a right in an emergency to stop the process of distribution of the MUI Tokens in limited situations, such as, but not limited to:
                        detection of a serious security issue;
                        serious network performance issue, depriving all users of equal treatment;
                        any type of material attack on the MUI Tokens, the platform, The Site, The  SovereignWallet App or the cryptocurrency networks; or
                        The occurrence of a Regulatory Event.
                        Refund of Payments
                        We are entitled, at Our discretion (including for the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of a Regulatory Event), to perform a refund of payment (partially or in full) made by a person in favour of Us in order to acquire the MUI Tokens ("Refund Receiver").
                        As We are only receiving payments in ETH, We will only make refund of payments in ETH.
                        Each Refund Receiver shall receive refund payments into their Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App. A Refund Receiver will not receive any refund if it does not have an Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App at that time. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to make refund where the delay or failure results from failure of the Refund Receiver to maintain an Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App.
                        Any refunds made in favor of the Refund Receiver will be reduced by an amount of any expenses that We have incurred or may incur in future in this regard, including any exchange fees, bank fees, agency and brokerage fees, taxes, charges, fees for blockchain transactions, etc.
                        Changes to Sale and Distribution procedures
                        We reserve the right to amend the terms and conditions of  each Phase of Public Sale set out therein, at Our sole discretion, at any time.
                        We shall publish a notice on The Site and The SovereignWallet App to inform Users of any material changes to the terms and conditions of each Phase of Public Sale as soon as reasonably practicable. It is Your responsibility to regularly check The Site and The SovereignWallet App for any such notices.

no action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving You or any of Your Affiliates with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the best of Your knowledge (after due and careful enquiry), threatened.

 EXHIBIT 2 - RISK FACTORS
An acquisition of the MUI Tokens involves a high degree of risk. Users should carefully consider the following information about these risks before they decide to buy the MUI Tokens. If any of the following risks actually occurs, it could have a material, adverse effect on the business, the MUI Token Platform and/or the value of the MUI Tokens.
We have described the risks and uncertainties that We believe are material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones the parties ultimately face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those We are currently not aware of or deem immaterial, may also have a material, adverse effect on the business, the MUI Token Platform and/or the value of the MUI Tokens.
1. RISKS CONNECTED TO THE VALUE OF MUI TOKENS
No Rights, Functionality or Features: The MUI Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, except for those which are specifically described in the White Paper and which may change from time to time.
Lack of Development of Market for MUI Tokens: Because there has been no prior public trading market for the MUI Tokens, the MUI Token sale may not result in an active or liquid market for the MUI Tokens, and their price may be highly volatile. An active public market may not develop or be sustained after the MUI Token sale. If a liquid trading market for the MUI Tokens does not develop, the price of the MUI Tokens may become more volatile and the MUI Token holder may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in the MUI Tokens at anytime. We do not in any way give any assurances that the MUI Tokens will be exchangeable on any cryptographic exchanges or secondary markets.
Risks Relating to Highly Speculative Traded Price: The valuation of digital MUI Tokens in a secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative. The MUI Tokens do not hold any ownership rights to Our assets or the assets of Our Affiliates and, therefore, are not backed by any tangible asset. Notwithstanding our automated stabilization tools, the sale price of the MUI Tokens may fluctuate greatly within a short period of time. There is a high risk that a MUI Token holder could lose his/her entire contribution amount and that the MUI Tokens could be rendered worthless.
MUI Tokens May Have No Value: The MUI Tokens may have no value and there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the MUI Tokens. We are not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of the MUI Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the MUI Tokens and/or the availability of any market for the MUI Tokens through third parties or otherwise.
MUI Tokens are Non-Refundable: We are not obliged to provide the MUI Token holders with a refund related to the MUI Tokens for any reason, and the MUI Token holders acknowledge and agree that they will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of a refund. No promises of future performance or price are or will be made in respect to the MUI Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the MUI Tokens will hold any particular value. Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to foreign laws or regulations, which may not be the same as the laws in the jurisdiction of the MUI Token holder.
2. BLOCKCHAIN AND SOFTWARE RISKS
Blockchain Delay Risk: On most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, the cryptocurrency sent as a payment for the MUI Tokens in the final seconds of the MUI Token sale may not get included into that period. The respective blockchain may not include the User’s transaction at the time User expects and the payment for the MUI Tokens may not reach the intended wallet address on the same day that the User sends the cryptocurrency.
Blockchain Congestion Risk: Most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the network in an attempt to gain an

 advantage in purchasing MUI Tokens. That may result in a situation where block producers may not include the User’s transaction when the User wants or the User’s transaction may not be included at all.
Risk of Software Weaknesses: The MUI Token Electronic Contract concept, the underlying software application and software platform are still in an early development stage and unproven. There are no representations and warranties that the process for creating the MUI Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free. There is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the cryptocurrency and/or the MUI Tokens.
Risk of New Technology: The MUI Token Platform, the MUI Tokens and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested. In particular, We believe that the automated stabilization tools that we have to manage the circulation of the MUI Tokens (such as the algorithmic central bank and the Sovereign Governance System) and the messenger-style wallet are first of their kind. Any such unique features of the MUI Token Platform and the MUI Tokens might not be capable of full completion, creation, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the full proposed functionality of the MUI Token Platform will be ever launched. User should not rely on the MUI Token Platform, the MUI Token Electronic Contract or the ability to receive the MUI Tokens associated with the MUI Token Platform in the future. Even if the MUI Token Platform is fully completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any MUI Tokens may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the MUI Token Platform and the MUI Tokens may become outdated.
3. SECURITY RISKS
Risk of Loss of Access to Wallet: The MUI Tokens may be held by a User only in his MUI Token wallet on The SovereignWallet App. Accordingly, loss of any details required to obtain access to such wallet could result in an inability to access the User’s MUI Tokens, access to the User’s MUI Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service the User uses, may be able to misappropriate a Users’ MUI Tokens.
No Assurance of MUI Token Security: While we believe our platform offers a high degree of security, there can be no assurance of this. The MUI Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the MUI Token Electronic Contract or the MUI Tokens in a variety of ways, including malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the MUI Token Platform rests on an open source software, there is the risk that the MUI Token contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may adversely affect the MUI Tokens or result in the loss of MUI Tokens, or the loss of ability to access or control the MUI Tokens. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and Users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.
Attacks on MUI Token Electronic Contract: The blockchain used for the MUI Token Electronic Contract is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the MUI Token Electronic Contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of the MUI Token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
Dependence on a Single Wallet: At present, the MUI Tokens can only be stored in the MUI Token wallet on The SovereignWallet App. Any failure of a User to maintain such a wallet may result in the User being unable to gain access to his MUI Tokens.
4. RISKS RELATING TO PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT
Risk Related to Reliance on Third Parties: Even if completed, the MUI Token Platform will rely, in whole or in part, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet requirements, all of which might have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform.
Dependence of Platform on Senior Management Team: The success of the senior management team of the Platform Provider, is dependent to a large degree on the services of each member of that team. The loss or diminution in the services of any member of the senior management team or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management personnel,

 could have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform. Competition for personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualified individuals, and this situation may adversely impact the Platform Provider’s ability to retain existing senior management and/or attract additional qualified senior management personnel, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform.
Dependence of Platform on Various Factors: The development of the MUI Token Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial feasibility or departure of key personnel.
Lack of Interest to the Platform: Even if the MUI Token Platform is completed, adopted and launched, the ongoing success of the MUI Token Platform relies on the interest and participation of third parties like developers. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the MUI Token Platform.
Changes to the Platform: The MUI Token Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although the project management team of the Platform Provider intends for the MUI Token Platform to have the features and specifications set forth in the White Paper, changes to such features and specifications can be made for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that the MUI Token Platform does not meet expectations of holder of the MUI Tokens.
Risk associated with Other Applications: The launch of the MUI Token Platform may encourage other, alternative projects with a similar business model, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which the MUI Token will have no intrinsic value.
Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Cryptocurrency Value: The proceeds of the sale of the MUI Tokens will be denominated in cryptocurrency, and may be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the First Phase Public Sale, the project management team for the Platform Provider may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the MUI Token Platform in the manner that it intended.
5. RISKS ARISING IN THE COURSE OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS
Risks Relating to the Commercial success of Our Application: The commercial success of the MUI Token Platform is subject to a number of factors beyond Our control and/or the control of the Platform Provider, such as:
ability / inability to meet users' expectations regarding the functionality of the MUI Token Platform;
interest from a limited number of users;
limited bandwidth to manage unexpected growth;
inability to continuously adapt the business model underlying the MUI Token to meet market needs;
significant competition from new and existing players in this space who introduce similar applications; and
any other new and untested technology that underlies the MUI Token Platform in the future may not function as planned.
Risks Relating to the Development and Acceptance of Blockchain Networks: The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, including the network on which the MUI Token is based, are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, which is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain-enabled digital representation of rights could have an adverse material effect on the utility of the MUI Tokens. The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks with which the MUI Token will rely and interact, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency industry, as well as blockchain networks, include, without limitation:
worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoin, Ether and other blockchain technologies;
government and quasi-government regulation of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;

 the maintenance and development of the open-source software of the Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrency networks;
changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using fiat currencies or existing networks;
general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and
a decline in the popularity or acceptance of the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other networks.
The slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may deter or delay the acceptance and adoption of the MUI Tokens.
Limited Historical Information: We and our Affiliates are start-up companies, and, therefore have limited prior business operations, financial historical information and other business information relating to the business operations or future prospects of the group.
Risk of Conflicts of Interest: We may be engaged in transactions with related parties, including companies controlled by Us or in which We own an interest, and other Affiliates, and may continue to do so in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise between any of Our Affiliates and Us, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on terms not determined by market forces.
Risks Related to Invalidation of Transactions: We and Our Affiliates have taken a variety of actions relating to the business that, if successfully challenged for not complying with Applicable Law, could be invalidated or could result in the imposition of liabilities on Us. Since applicable legislation may be subject to many different interpretations, We may not be able to successfully defend any challenge brought against such transactions, and the invalidation of any such transactions or imposition of any such liability may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the MUI Token Platform.
Risk Arising from Emerging Markets: We operate in several emerging markets. Emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic and political risks. Emerging economies are subject to rapid change and the User understands that the information set out in this Token Usage Agreement and the White Paper may become outdated relatively quickly.
Lack of Information: A holder of MUI Tokens may not be able to obtain all information it would want regarding the MUI Token on a timely basis or at all going forward. It is possible that the holder may not therefore be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that have occurred which could affect the MUI Tokens.
Compliance Burden: Our business and industry is subject to compliance with a number of laws including those relating to data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements including those that could require Us to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm Our reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of Our security measures, adversely impact Our ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the MUI Token Platform.
6. GOVERNMENTAL RISKS
Uncertain Regulatory Framework: The regulatory status of cryptocurrency, digital assets, blockchain technology and decentralised exchanges is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies particularly as We believe the MUI Token Platform offers several first-of-its-kind features. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptocurrency, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could adversely impact the MUI Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that the MUI Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. You should be aware that neither We nor the White Paper nor the MUI Tokens are registered with any securities regulator in any jurisdiction including, in Singapore, the Monetary Authority of

 Singapore. We and/or the Platform Provider (as applicable) may cease the distribution of the MUI Tokens, the development of the MUI Token Platform and/or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.
Failure to Obtain, Maintain or Renew Licenses and Permits. We may require a number of permits, licenses, authorisations, consents, decrees, waivers, approvals and filings (statutory, regulatory or otherwise) to lawfully operate the business in accordance with Applicable Law (the “Approvals”). There is a risk that requirements for Approvals for carrying out the First Phase Public Sale may be adopted in the future and may relate to Us. In this case, the business will depend on obtaining such required Approvals, the continuing validity of such Approvals and Our compliance with their terms. Regulatory authorities will exercise considerable discretion in the timing of Approval issuance and renewal and the monitoring of Our compliance with the terms of such Approvals. Requirements which may by imposed by these authorities and which may require Us and/or the Platform Provider to comply with numerous standards, recruit qualified personnel, maintain necessary technical equipment and quality control systems, monitor operations, maintain appropriate filings and, upon request, submit appropriate information to the licensing authorities, may be costly and time- consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of operation of the MUI Token Platform. Further, private individuals and the public at large may possess rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the Approval process, including through intervention in courts and political pressure. Accordingly, the Approvals We may need may not be issued or renewed, or if issued or renewed, may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements which restrict Our ability to conduct operations or to do so profitably.
Risk of Government Action: The industry in which We operate is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine Our operations and/or pursue enforcement actions against Us. All of this may subject Us and/or the Platform Provider to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Us to restructure Our operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Our reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the MUI Tokens and/or the development of the MUI Token Platform.
Risk of Burdensomeness of Applicable Laws, Regulations, and Standards: Failure to comply with Applicable Law or the findings of government inspections, or increased governmental regulation of Our operations, could result in substantial additional compliance costs or various sanctions, which could materially adversely affect Our business and the MUI Token Platform. Our operations and properties are subject to regulation by various government entities and agencies, in connection with ongoing compliance with Applicable Law. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in matters of enforcement and interpretation of Applicable Law. Respective authorities have the right to conduct periodic inspections of Our operations and properties throughout the year. Any such future inspections may conclude that We have violated laws, decrees or regulations, and We may be unable to refute such conclusions or remedy the violations. Our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or the findings of government inspections may result in the imposition of fines or penalties or more severe sanctions or in requirements We cease certain business activities, or in criminal and administrative penalties applicable to Our officers. Any such decisions, requirements or sanctions, or any increase in governmental regulation of respective operations, could increase Our costs and have a material adverse effect on the business and the MUI Token Platform.
Unlawful or Arbitrary Government Action: Governmental authorities may have a high degree of discretion and, at times, act selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary to law or influenced by political or commercial considerations. Moreover, governmental authorities also have the power in certain circumstances, by regulation or government act, to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts. Unlawful, selective or arbitrary governmental actions have reportedly included the denial or withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities have also used common defects in matters surrounding a MUI Token sale as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate or to void any related transaction, often for political purposes. In this environment, Our competitors may receive preferential treatment from the government, potentially giving them a competitive advantage over Us.
Risks Relating to Taxation: The tax treatment of acquisition of MUI Tokens (through purchase or otherwise) is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for acquirers. Each acquirer must seek its own tax advice in connection with the purchase of MUI Tokens. The acquisition of MUI Tokens may result in adverse tax consequences to acquirers, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements. Each acquirer should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of the acquisition of MUI Tokens.

 7. RISKS RELATING TO THE FIRST PHASE PUBLIC SALE
Risks Relating to the First Phase Public Sale Process: You are subject to certain risks as a result of the First Phase Public Saleprocess. Youunderstandthattheserisksincludethefollowing:
We reserve the right to change the timing, sale price, and number of MUI Tokens available for sale at any time during the First Phase Public Sale Period;
We reserve the right to terminate the sale process at any time and withdraw any unsold MUI Tokens from the First Phase Public Sale; and
You may not be able to acquire any MUI Tokens if among other things, We believe you are a Restricted Person or that a Regulatory Event has occurred.

(such time the "First Phase Expiration Time").
The period starting from the First Phase Sale Launch Time and ending at the First Phase Expiration Time shall be referred to
as the "First Phase Public Sale Period".
For Users participating in the First Phase Public Sale Period, the Token exchange rate will be as follows: 1 ETH for 6000 MUI
Token (the "Token Exchange Rate").
The minimum purchase requirement applicable for the First Phase Public Sale is MUI tokens in an amount that equals 1 ETH
(i.e. 6000 MUI Token).
2. Process for Purchase of MUI Tokens-Payment Information
Payment for the purchase of MUI Tokens shall only be accepted: in advance;
in Ethereum; and
by transfer of such Ethereum to Us through Your Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App, which can be achieved by clicking on the "Buy" button on the market UI in The SovereignWallet App (such event a "Purchase Event" and each such valid purchase, a "Purchase").
For the avoidance of doubt, the price of the MUI Tokens shall not be set in fiat currency and We will not accept any fiat currency towards the payment of the MUI Tokens.
A MUI Token is divisible and therefore fractional components of a MUI Token may be in issue up to six decimal places. However, we shall not issue any fractional components of MUI Tokens in the First Phase Public Sale.
A User's entitlement to MUI Tokens (if any) in the First Phase Public Sale Period (the "Token Entitlement Amount") shall be: the amount of Ethereum submitted to Us in a Purchase Event; divided by
the Token Exchange Rate.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, We will only consider a payment for the MUI Tokens by a User as completed once We are in a position to confirm receipt of such payment including confirming to Our satisfaction that any payment transaction has not been cancelled or reversed by the respective blockchain ledger.

 For the avoidance of doubt, Users are reminded that on most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, the cryptocurrency sent as a payment for the MUI Tokens in the final seconds of the First Phase Public Sale may not get included into that period. The respective blockchain may not include the User's transaction at the time User expects and the payment for the MUI Tokens may not reach the intended wallet address on the same day that the User sends the cryptocurrency.
If We are unable to confirm payment as described in Clause 2.6 hereof, the transaction for payment for the MUI Tokens will be deemed cancelled and reversed by the respective blockchain ledger. In this case, the respective amount of payment made by a User will be refunded to such User without distribution to him of any MUI Tokens subject to the terms and conditions herein.
3. Process for Purchase of MUI Tokens -Additional Information
We shall have certain information on the First Phase Public Sale available on The Site. However, purchases of MUI Tokens can only be completed on The SovereignWallet App.
To purchase the MUI Tokens through The SovereignWallet App, a User must:
complete certain registration procedures on The SovereignWallet App to set up a user account;
complete Our KYC process including submitting any required documentation to our service providers; and await verification.
Users are reminded that given the complexity of the KYC process, the verification may fail or be delayed and that they can only purchase the MUI Tokens once they have been verified by Us from a KYC perspective.
Once a User has been verified:
We will open an account for the User on The SovereignWallet App which will include an Ethereum wallet and a MUI token wallet;
such User will be able to make payment by of ETH from its Ethereum wallet for purchase of MUI Tokens in the First Phase Public Sale; and
such User shall be able to purchase MUI Tokens and see registered purchases of MUI Tokens within its MUI token account on The SovereignWallet App.
We reserve the right to refuse or cancel purchase requests for MUI Tokens at any time in Our sole discretion, including cases when
the information provided by User upon any requests is not sufficient, inaccurate or misleading; a User is believed to be a Restricted Person; or
a User has not complied with any of the requirements of The SovereignWallet App.
In the case specified in Clause 3.5 hereof, We may, at Our sole discretion, either:
retain all the funds paid by the respective payer if required by Applicable Law; or refund to the payer of the funds in accordance with Clause 8 hereof.

 4. Bonus Programs
Certain Users may be eligible to receive additional MUI Tokens at no payment ("Bonus Tokens") based on the eligibility criteria
detailed in our White Paper.
Other than as stated in Clause 4.1 hereof, We may launch different bonus programs enabling different persons to receive the Bonus Tokens. Different bonus programs may be launched for the benefit of different persons.
Bonus programs stated in Clauses 4.1 to 4.2 inclusive may be additive, however, to the extent that applies to Users, the Bonus Tokens to be due within each such bonus program can be accrued only depending on the number of MUI Tokens that was actually paid for by a respective User.
Bonus Tokens may also be issued in fractional components of MUI Tokens.
5. User's Wallets
To purchase the MUI Tokens, a User must utilize the wallet in The SovereignWallet App that is established and operational and for which such a user controls the private key.
For the avoidance of doubt, Users shall not be permitted to use any other wallet including any wallet that belongs to an exchange for cryptocurrency.
6. Creation and Distribution of MUI Tokens
Through the MUI Token Electronic Contract, a maximum total of 1,000, 000,000 (one billion) MUI Tokens have been generated and are being held by Us pending distribution.
Following a valid Purchase Event in respect of a User, We shall promptly procure: the reflection of such results into the MUI Token Electronic Contract; and
the allocation of an amount of MUI Tokens equal to the Token Entitlement Amount to that User through the MUI Token Electronic Contract to their respective MUI Token wallets on The SovereignWallet App.
At the end of the First Phase Public Sale Period, we will procure that the MUI Token Electronic Contract has a fully updated results of the sale and distribution of MUI Tokens in the First Phase Public Sale (and including the number of the Bonus Tokens issued in the First Phase Public Sale Period, if applicable).
The total number of MUI Tokens which will be distributed through the Token Electronic Contract shall be equal to the sum of the following:
the aggregate of:
(a) the total number of the MUI Tokens paid for and distributed to Users in the First Phase Public Sale together with the total number of the Bonus Tokens accrued to any parties (and that are credited as paid for) in the First Phase Public Sale, in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof (the "First Phase Public Sale Tokens"); and
(b) the total number of the MUI Tokens paid for and distributed to Users in any further public sales that we may conduct together with the total number of the Bonus Tokens accrued to any parties (and that are credited as paid for) in any such further public sales, in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof (the "Future Public Sale Tokens"),
provided that the aggregate number of First Phase Public Sale Tokens and the Future Public Sale Tokens, in any case, shall not exceed 800,000,000 (eight hundred million) MUI Tokens;

      7.
the total number of MUI Tokens that are allocated to Us (and credited as paid for) for future distributions to Our team, Our advisors, and Our initial Users ("Retained Tokens") which shall not exceed 100,000,000 (one hundred million) MUI Tokens; and
the total number of MUI Tokens that we distribute to Users as Bonus Tokens from time to time in connection with their use of The SovereignWallet App (and which are credited as paid for) which shall not exceed 100,000,000 (one hundred million) MUI Tokens.
The number of MUI Tokens due to each User, Us or the third party (if any), will be distributed by the Token Electronic Contract.
The Retained Tokens will be distributed by the MUI Token Electronic Contract to Us. We anticipate using the Retained Tokens, in Our sole discretion, for the purposes indicated in the White Paper.
Prior to the First Phase Public Sale Period, We have already conducted a pre-sale period in which 241,656,353 MUI Tokens were offered on a discounted basis by us from the Future Public Sale Tokens (the "Pre-Sale").
Stop of Distribution Process
We reserve a right in an emergency to stop the process of distribution of the MUI Tokens in limited situations, such as, but not limited to:
detection of a serious security issue;
serious network performance issue, depriving all users of equal treatment;
any type of material attack on the MUI Tokens, the platform, The Site, The SovereignWallet App or the cryptocurrency networks; or
the occurrence of a Regulatory Event.
Refund of Payments
We are entitled, at Our discretion (including for the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of a Regulatory Event), to perform a refund of payment (partially or in full) made by a person in favour of Us in order to acquire the MUI Tokens ("Refund Receiver").
As We are only receiving payments in ETH, We will only make refund of payments in ETH.
Each Refund Receiver shall receive refund payments into their Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App. A Refund Receiver will not receive any refund if it does not have an Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App at that time. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to make refund where the delay or failure results from failure of the Refund Receiver to maintain an Ethereum wallet on The SovereignWallet App.
Any refunds made in favor of the Refund Receiver will be reduced by an amount of any expenses that We have incurred or may incur in future in this regard, including any exchange fees, bank fees, agency and brokerage fees, taxes, charges, fees for blockchain transactions, etc.
Changes to Sale and Distribution procedures
We reserve the right to amend the terms and conditions of the First Phase Public Sale set out therein, at Our sole discretion, at any time.
We shall publish a notice on The Site and The SovereignWallet App to inform Users of any material changes to the terms and conditions of the First Phase Public Sale as soon as reasonably practicable. It is Your responsibility to regularly check The Site and The SovereignWallet App for any such notices.
